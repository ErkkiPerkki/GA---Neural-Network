1. Feed forward #
2. Cost derivative of error #
	= -2 * (correctOutput - networkOutput)

3. Ouput Derivatives
Weight derivatives #
	= previousActivation * SigmoidDerivative(preActivation)
Bias derivatives #
	= SigmoidDerivative(preActivation)

Previous activation derivatives
	= weight * SigmoidDerivative(preActivation)

4. Hidden Derivatives
Weight Derivatives
	= trainingData * SigmoidDerivatives(preActivation)
Bias Derivatives
	= SigmoidDerivative(preActivation)

5. Update weights and biases
New weights
	= LEARN_RATE * costDerivative * activationDerivative * weightDerivative
Output weights
	= LEARN_RATE * costDerivative * weightDerivative
